      <p>In the modern era, machine learning and data science is quickly becoming an essential piece of a service or product. The TACT method is a way to:
      <ul>
          <li>Meet *customer need* without guessing</li>
          <li>Deliver <em>high quality</em> models that have less defects</li>
          <li>Reduce *cost* of hiring machine learning experts that work within vacuums</li>
              <li>Increase *communication* between product stakeholders</li>
              <li>Show the results and get buy in</li>
      </ul></p>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>The contributors to this have been directly involved with delivering hundreds of machine learning models,
        data science visualizations and data pipelines. We have seen the high interest credit card debt that google
        talked about with machine learning projects first hand.</p>

        <p>After years of struggling to remember models like CRISP-DM (insert others) we came up with TACT which simply
        stands for Target, Arrange, Compose, and Transmit. This balances both the production with the evaluation aspects
        of all machine learning and data science projects.</p>

        <p>The goal of course is to reduce rework, work in progress, waiting, skills, time, communication overhead, over
        production, and delivering results less than what the customer wants.</p>

        <h2>1. Target</h2>
        <p>Machine learning and data science can have the the unfortunate side effect of being a solution looking for
        problems. The first step of the TACT method is to understand the customer need well.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-3">
        <h2>2. Arrange</h2>
        <p>Data science without data is just science. That means the second step is to arrange data pieces but only the
        essential data. This means sorting through data and selecting only what's relevant, straightening the data
        whether that's melting or unmelting the data frames, and finally cleaning up data for usage.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-3">
        <h2>3. Compose</h2>
        <p>Data science is a focus on modeling and coming up with insight from the arranged data and information. This
        means putting our data either through statistics, traditional machine learning models, or fancy deep learning
        architectures. The focus is finding the simplest model to make the standard.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-3">
        <h2>4. Transmit</h2>
        <p>Finally comes the point where the insight that is arrived upon is transmitted to either internal or external
        customers. This means deploying the code to a staging or production server as well as presenting the results to
        the stakeholders in the project.</p>
